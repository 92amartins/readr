[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/readr)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=readr) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tidyverse/readr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tidyverse/readr) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/tidyverse/readr?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tidyverse/readr) [![Coverage Status](http://codecov.io/github/tidyverse/readr/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/tidyverse/hadley/readr?branch=master)

The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read tabular data into R. The most important functions are:

-   Read delimited files: `read_delim()`, `read_csv()`, `read_tsv()`, `read_csv2()`.
-   Read fixed width files: `read_fwf()`, `read_table()`.
-   Read lines: `read_lines()`.
-   Read whole file: `read_file()`.
-   Re-parse existing data frame: `type_convert()`.

Installation
------------

``` r
# The easiest way to get readr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just readr:
install.packages("readr")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/readr")
```

Usage
-----

``` r
library(readr)

# Read a csv file into a data frame
read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
#> Parsed with column specification:
#> cols(
#>   mpg = col_double(),
#>   cyl = col_integer(),
#>   disp = col_double(),
#>   hp = col_integer(),
#>   drat = col_double(),
#>   wt = col_double(),
#>   qsec = col_double(),
#>   vs = col_integer(),
#>   am = col_integer(),
#>   gear = col_integer(),
#>   carb = col_integer()
#> )
#> # A tibble: 32 Ã— 11
#>      mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb

See `vignette("column-types")` on how readr parses columns, and how you can override the defaults.

Comparison
----------

### To base R

Compared to the corresponding base functions, readr functions:

-   Use a consistent naming scheme for the parameters (e.g. `col_names` and `col_types` not `header` and `colClasses`).

-   Are much faster (up to 10x faster).

-   Have a helpful progress bar if loading is going to take a while.

-   All functions work exactly the same way regardless of the current locale. To override the US-centric defaults, use `locale()`.

### To `fread()`

[data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) has a function similar to `read_csv()` called fread. Compared to fread, readr:

-   Is slower (currently ~1.2-2x slower. If you want absolutely the best performance, use `data.table::fread()`.

-   Readr has a slightly more sophisticated parser, recognising both doubled ("""") and backslash escapes ("""). Readr allows you to read factors and date times directly from disk.

-   `fread()` saves you work by automatically guessing the delimiter, whether or not the file has a header, how many lines to skip by default and more. Readr forces you to supply these parameters.

-   The underlying designs are quite different. Readr is designed to be general, and dealing with new types of rectangular data just requires implementing a new tokenizer. `fread()` is designed to be as fast as possible. `fread()` is pure C, readr is C++ (and Rcpp).
