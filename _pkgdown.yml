- title: Column parsers
  desc: >
    Each parser comes in two forms: `parse_xxx()` which is used to parse
    vectors that already exist in R and `col_xxx()` which is used to parse
    vectors as they are loaded by a `read_xxx()` function.
  contents:
  - parse_character
  - parse_datetime
  - parse_factor
  - parse_guess
  - parse_number
  - col_skip

- title: Locale controls
  desc: >
    The "locale" controls all options that vary from country-to-country or
    language-to-language. See `vignette("locales")` for more details.
  contents:
  - locale
  - date_names

- title: Write rectangular files
  desc: >
    Despite its name, readr also provides a number of functions to __write__
    data frames to disk, and to convert them to in-memory strings.
  contents:
  - starts_with("format_")
  - write_csv

- title: Low-level IO and debugging tools
  desc: >
    These functions can be used with non-rectangular files, and to help
    debug rectangular files that fail to parse.
  contents:
  - read_file
  - read_lines
  - write_file
  - write_lines
  - count_fields
  - guess_encoding
  - type_convert

- title: Chunked API
  desc: >
    The chunked API allows you to read in files that are larger than memory,
    processing a chunk at a time. The API experimental: please try it out but
    be aware that it may change in the future.
  contents:
  - callback
  - read_delim_chunked
  - read_lines_chunked
