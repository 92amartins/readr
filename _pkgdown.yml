- title: Column parsers
  desc: >
    Each parser comes in two forms: `parse_xxx()` which is used to parse
    vectors that already exist in R and `col_xxx()` which is used to parse
    vectors as they are loaded by a `read_xxx()` function.
  contents:
  - parse_character

  - parse_factor
  - parse_guess
  - parse_number
  - col_skip

- title: Locale

    processing a chunk at a time. The API experimental: please try it out but
    be aware that it may change in the future.
  contents:
  - callback
  - read_delim_chunked
  - read_lines_chunked
