[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/readr)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=readr)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tidyverse/readr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tidyverse/readr)
[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/tidyverse/readr?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tidyverse/readr)
[![Coverage Status](http://codecov.io/github/tidyverse/readr/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/tidyverse/hadley/readr?branch=master)

The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read tabular data into R. The most important functions are:

* Read delimited files: `read_delim()`, `read_csv()`, `read_tsv()`,
  `read_csv2()`.
* Read fixed width files: `read_fwf()`, `read_table()`.
* Read lines: `read_lines()`.
* Read whole file: `read_file()`.
* Re-parse existing data frame: `type_convert()`.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get readr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just readr:
install.packages("readr")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/readr")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(readr)

# Read a csv file into a data frame
read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
```

See `vignette("column-types")` on how readr parses columns, and how you can override the defaults.


## Comparison

### To base R

Compared to the corresponding base functions, readr functions:

* Use a consistent naming scheme for the parameters (e.g. `col_names` and 
 `col_types` not `header` and `colClasses`).
 
* Are much faster (up to 10x faster).

* Have a helpful progress bar if loading is going to take a while.

* All functions work exactly the same way regardless of the current locale.
  To override the US-centric defaults, use `locale()`.

### To `fread()`

[data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) has a function similar to `read_csv()` called fread. Compared to fread, readr:

* Is slower (currently ~1.2-2x slower. If you want absolutely the best 
  performance, use `data.table::fread()`.
  
* Readr has a slightly more sophisticated parser, recognising both 
  doubled ("""") and backslash escapes ("\""). Readr allows you to read
  factors and date times directly from disk.
  
* `fread()` saves you work by automatically guessing the delimiter, whether
  or not the file has a header, how many lines to skip by default and 
  more. Readr forces you to supply these parameters.
  
* The underlying designs are quite different. Readr is designed to be
  general, and dealing with new types of rectangular data just requires 
  implementing a new tokenizer. `fread()` is designed to be as fast as 
  possible. `fread()` is pure C, readr is C++ (and Rcpp).

Thanks to:

* [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5) for showing me the beauty of
  deterministic finite automata for parsing, and for teaching me why I 
  should write a tokenizer.
  
* [JJ Allaire](https://github.com/jjallaire) for helping me come up with a
  design that makes very few copies, and is easy to extend.
